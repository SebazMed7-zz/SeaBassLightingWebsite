This is where I wish to make a Lighting Design Web Page for my portfolio.
The layout is simple, home page.
SLot 1- Resume
Slot 2- Portfolio
Slot 3- Contact
Slot 4- Misc.
I want each slot to have its own shape to it. The front page slots would look like this \||/. 
Each slot has a picture for its representation. When you hover your mouse over it, the picture in the column changes, along with a different backround of the same show. Each time you reload the webpage, you get a different shows.
